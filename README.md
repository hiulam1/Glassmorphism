# Glassmorphism Card with React Native Skia

This project demonstrates a card designed in the style of glassmorphism, utilizing React Native Skia for the rendering. The glassmorphism style emulates the look of frosted glass and provides a modern, aesthetic touch to UI components.

## Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:

- Ensure you have [Expo](https://expo.dev/) installed on your system. Expo is a framework and platform for universal React applications.
- Install React Native Skia. React Native Skia brings the power of Skia, a high-performance 2D graphics library, to React Native. For installation instructions, refer to the [React Native Skia documentation](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/).

### Clone and Run:

- Clone this repository to your local device.
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
- Run `expo start` to start the project. This will open up a development server, and you can then view the project in the Expo Go app on your mobile device or in a simulator/emulator on your computer.

Enjoy the sleek look of glassmorphism in your React Native applications!
